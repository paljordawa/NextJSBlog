Have you heard of “middle child syndrome”? It’s the (unscientific) theory that kids that have both older and younger siblings tend to feel ignored and excluded, because parents tend to pay more attention to the firstborn and baby of the family. As a mom, I don’t agree with the idea, but since I write about tech, I couldn’t help but draw comparisons with this year’s iPhones.


The iPhone XS Max is the shining star of the new lineup – with its large display and battery, it’s the one that most people have their eyes on. The iPhone XR on the other hand is the most affordable (by Apple standards) device of the lot, and is an attractive option for those with tighter purse strings. So where does that leave the iPhone XS? It doesn’t have the big battery or display of the XS Max, nor is it anywhere close to affordable. But as I found after using the device for a couple of weeks, this ‘middle child’ is pretty special too.

Before I continue, I’d urge you to head over to our iPhone XS Max review if you want the finer details. If not, read on.
