DigitalOcean is a cloud infrastructure provider that provides cloud computing services to business entities. It is used to scale by deploying DigitalOcean applications that run parallel across multiple cloud servers without compromising performance.


In January 2018, it acquired the title of the third-largest Cloud hosting company globally in web-facing computers.

## History of DigitalOcean
In 2003, DigitalOcean founders Ben and Moise Uretsky formed the server stack. Most companies targeted only corporate customers, who largely needed cloud infrastructure to manage their servers. After so much research, on 24 June 2011, it was generated by Ben Uretsky, Moisey Uretsky, Mitch Wainer, Jeff Carr, and Alec Hartman. The head office of DigitalOcean is located in New York City.
