Git is a DevOps tool used for source code management. It is a free and open-source version control system used to handle small to very large projects efficiently. Git is used to tracking changes in the source code, enabling multiple developers to work together on non-linear development. Linus Torvalds created Git in 2005 for the development of the Linux kernel

Before diving deep, let’s explain a scenario before Git:

Developers used to submit their codes to the central server without having copies of their own
Any changes made to the source code were unknown to the other developers
There was no communication between any of the developers
business

Now let’s look at the scenario after Git:

Every developer has an entire copy of the code on their local systems
Any changes made to the source code can be tracked by others
There is regular communication between the developers
